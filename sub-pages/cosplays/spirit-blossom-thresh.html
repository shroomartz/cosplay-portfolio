    <!--Why I cosplayed Thresh & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Thresh</h2>
    <p>
      My go-to cosplay if I need to cosplay anything, and arguably the cosplay I’m most known for. This is what motivated me to get back into cosplaying and dedicate myself to the hobby after a 
      period of being unable to find out why I really wanted to cosplay. For a long while, I wanted a guy that could pull off masculine features along with a typical “feminine” color palette, and 
      Spirit Blossom Thresh provided a great combination of both, as the skin turns him from the iconic green burning skeleton demon we all knew and love into a pretty man with a long purple ponytail 
      (Gakupo reference, anyone?), with a white and blue/turquoise sleeve and a pink/purple train cape and accompanying bottom accessories. Despite the unconventional human take on his normally monstrous 
      character, Spirit Blossom Thresh took a humanized Thresh to a tasteful level, with a solid in-game skin as well.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Being a purchased cosplay meant I can experience a good quality cosplay without worrying about sewing. I bought this in the middle of the pandemic, where this was my first cosplay without a conventional 
      shirt or any other torso cover. I was concerned about looking “shirtless” when going out in this cosplay, which made me wear separate tops with the cosplay to cover myself and ignore his canon shirtless look. 
      This made me less recognizable as Thresh, especially since I didn’t have his scythe at the time. I eventually decided to stick with his canon shirtless look at Fanime 2022 and beyond, and ever since, I’m 
      comfortable with showing Thresh in his canon shirtless version with his exposed midriff and pecs, and he quickly became the cosplay I choose to do whenever I have a cosplay convention coming up and I need a 
      cosplay to wear.
