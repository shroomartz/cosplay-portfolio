    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Teemo Cho (they/them), a cosplayer based in San Francisco, CA. I
      discovered cosplay back in middle and high school, discovering my passion
      for the hobby with my earliest cosplays in 2015. While only initially
      using thrifted items, $30, and random materials, I managed to create a
      handful of cosplays that caught peoples’ attention. My first cosplay was
      Annie from League of Legends, during a Halloween day in middle school.
      After finding out that costuming was a hobby I was willing to do, I made
      DJ Sona’s helmet with cardboard, party streamers, sandpaper, nail polish,
      and lots of paint. I already had some interest in cosplay even though I
      never knew that "cosplay" was a widely used term.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later that year, when entering high school, I received help from family
      friends to create a Star Guardian Lux cosplay to wear during Halloween
      that year. That Lux cosplay became a part of my identity throughout the
      school, as I had emerging fashion interests. Over the next few years, I
      took a break from cosplaying, but Lux inspired me to keep sewing my own
      outfits. In 2018, I decided to return to cosplay with Star Guardian Miss
      Fortune for Halloween 2018 and K/DA Evelynn for a school festival in
      Spring 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      After high school, cosplaying was more of a minor side thing for me, even
      throughout the pandemic. One day, Riot Games themselves featured them in
      my Spirit Blossom Yone cosplay, and now that I got peoples' attention on
      Riot's social media posts, I decided to dedicate my near future to
      cosplay.

      To me, cosplay bridges gaming, fancy outfits, creativity, and an
      expression of myself.
