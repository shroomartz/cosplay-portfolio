    <!--Why I cosplayed Flora & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Flora</h2>
    <p>
      The long pink train skirt combined with the pink petal skirt felt like a good fit for the Cherry Blossom Festival, where I debuted the cosplay in the first place. 
      It was also a way to re-use my Flora wig and shoes as I was in the process of scrapping my Cosmix cosplay.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting Process</h2>
    <p>
      Making the base outfit took 16 hours, with 6 hours of cutting fabric and 10 hours of sewing the fabric. The petal skirt was unlike other skirts that I sewn in the past, 
      as I had to make specific shapes for the skirt and not just gather a bunch of fabric and pleats at once. When I made the petal skirt, I used a short wide strip of pink satin 
      to make the base of the skirt where all the petals would be attached to. Then, I added on the sewn petals accordingly, starting from attaching petals on the top of the skirt 
      and ending with the bottom of the pink satin strip that formed the base of my skirt. I saved an extra pink petal to hand sew it to my green sleeveless top to form the base of 
      the pink poofy part of Floraâ€™s outfit. I used the same pink netting material I used for her wings to make the poof of the top. The wings were arguably the hardest part, as I 
      had to spend 3 nights cutting the wire frames, attaching the fabric, and sewing down the fabric by hand to hug the wire frames in order to allow the wings to attach properly.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      The bottom part of the skirt and the long pink train was a huge success, as it looked the most polished and an integral part of the cosplay. I wish I was able to sew the top better, 
      and more importantly, I wish I knew how to better make cosplay fairy wings, as the wings turned out to be a horrible drooping mess. At the very least, I made a few little girls 
      a happy highlight of their days and childhoods by letting them take pictures with me when I debuted the cosplay during Cherry Blossom Festival. At least there is potential 
      for the Harmonix cosplay, to further illuminate the girl inside me.
