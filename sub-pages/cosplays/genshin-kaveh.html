    <!--Why I cosplayed Kaveh & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Kaveh</h2>
    <p>
      I initially had difficulty choosing between Kaveh or Alhaitham for the next Genshin cosplay I would do. I ended up buying both cosplays, and after trying each cosplay out, I found that 
      I was more comfortable cosplaying Kaveh. Kaveh cosplayers weren’t as abundant as Alhaitham cosplayers at the time, so it felt better to choose to cosplay Kaveh. Kaveh’s outfit also felt 
      better to use for cosplay and non-cosplay purposes - I could use Kaveh’s outfit as a dressy outfit for a night out; no wig needed! I promptly kept Kaveh to cosplay in the near future, and 
      sold the Alhaitham cosplay to a local cosplayer.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting Process</h2>
    <p>
      Buying the cosplay from AliExpress, I did not have high expectations for the quality as I expected the cosplay to start falling apart shortly after I took the cosplay out of the bag. The cosplay was okay, 
      but definitely cheaply made. The clip holding the turquoise blue sashes of Kaveh’s belt was attached with hot glue that quickly loosened, dropping the sashes on the ground after an evening outside with it. 
      Luckily, I was notified of it and was able to sew the clip on the following day. Still, Kaveh would not be a cosplay I would see doing long-term simply because of the quality of the cosplay.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Kaveh probably fit me the most for a flashy outfit that fits me even without a wig, even more than Thoma or Albedo. I appreciated the white blouse and the dark pants, and can see myself wearing the blouse and 
      cape over gray slacks or khakis. Kaveh’s outfit feels versatile enough to justify wearing it as a dressy casual outfit.
