    <h1>Website Accessibility Statement</h1>
    <h2>Context to This Statement</h2>
    <p>
    Personally, I seek to ensure that everyone, including people with disabilities, are able to view my experiences cosplaying. Having worked with people with cognitive disabilities in the past, I’ve seen the pain of those who have a difficult time viewing web content. Because of this, I want to ensure that content on my cosplay site is fully accessible to everyone. 
    Cosplay is for everyone in every shape and form, such is the same for viewing cosplays. It would be ironic for me to say I value inclusivity and NOT practice it on the web by having low color contrasts, unclear indicators, or other things that could be rage-inducing for viewers that want to see my work.
    </p>
    <p>My site has accessibility features that should allow everyone to view my website easily, such as:</p>
    <ul class="text-ul">
        <li class="text-ul-item">Succinct alternative text descriptions for meaningful non-text elements, like images.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Access to my site that does not require the use of a mouse.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Associating form  fields with proper labels.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Avoiding posting images of text on my site.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Clear indicators of selected content.</li> 
        <li class="text-ul-item">Information that is not dependent on color for meaning (ex. No “Click this pink button to view my Lux cosplay.”) </li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Choosing fonts that are easy to read and understand, while still looking crisp.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Legible text that can be increased or decreased in sizes.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Sufficient color contrast between all elements.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Simple language so that I don’t confuse viewers with autism, dyslexia, or other disabilities that try to understand my content.</li>
        <li class="text-ul-item">Using proper heading levels and HTML elements so that people using screen readers can clearly understand how my website is layed out.</li>
    </ul>
