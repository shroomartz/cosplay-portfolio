    <!--Why I cosplayed Flora & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Flora</h2>
    <p>
      I felt the need to cosplay as a woman after cosplaying as many men, as my only other woman cosplay was K/DA Evelynn when buying Flora. 
      I also wanted to do a Winx Club cosplay, which led me into cosplaying the Enchantix form of Flora.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting Process</h2>
    <p>
      I bought the cosplay through Miccostumes, and added my own ribbon that I bought locally. As the gloves Miccostumes provided were sheer tulle, 
      I had to buy my own pink satin gloves for the cosplay through Amazon.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I feel that instead of sewing my own pink shorts to wear underneath the cosplay, it would be better to buy the pink shorts, as my own pink shorts 
      were too long and were easily seen in photos. The short dress also made it feel like I wasnâ€™t wearing much, which made me a little uncomfortable 
      compared to my other more covered cosplays. I eventually sold the Enchantix cosplay on Mercari.
