    <!--Why I cosplayed Xiao & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Xiao</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to host a Genshin cosplay gathering during the Lantern Rite season/Lunar New Year season, and I was debating on Liyue characters to cosplay. I had thoughts about being 
      either Xiao, Chongyun, Zhongli, or Yun Jin, which narrowed down to Xiao and Zhongli, with Xiao winning as I found a decent used cosplay that I could use for the Lantern Rite 
      season before selling out the cosplay to others. I also thought about cosplaying Xiao back in 2022.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting Process</h2>
    <p>
      The Xiao cosplay was secondhand, with a few issues with the cosplay that were easy to fix with a needle and some thread. The medallions on his loincloth were replaced with cheap foam 
      for the cosplay that fell off during the Lantern Rite gathering. I was able to save and detach all 3 of them before sewing them all onto the cosplay. The Xiao cosplay was then 
      sold to another cosplayer as I do not see myself cosplaying as Xiao until the next Lunar New Year.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Xiao was the first character I wore a short wig for, and in some ways, hiding my actual hair felt a bit easier than if I wore a longer wig. I initially feared that my actual hair would show 
      in the back due to the Xiao wig being short, but it was great to feel that the Xiao wig was big enough to tuck all my actual hair inside. Barring the silicone abs suit and black 
      heeled boots I wore for this cosplay, it was fun wearing it and provided some warmth during the rain.
