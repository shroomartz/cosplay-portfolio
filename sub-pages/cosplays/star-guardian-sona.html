    <!--Why I cosplayed Sona & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Sona</h2>
    <p>
      When I first started playing League of Legends back in 2014, I was drawn to playing Sona. She quickly became my main then as her kit was simple to use, 
      and she had a fair amount of pretty skins. Then, as Star Guardian Lux (and the Star Guardian skinline) came out in May 2015, I was hoping that the music girl would get a 
      Star Guardian skin. My wishes became true in 2022, when Sona received a spot in the skinline! Sona is one of the better Star Guardian skins that came out in 2022, and 
      considering it was her first cutesy/pretty skin since Sweetheart in 2016 (wow, 6 years and counting!) Star Guardian Sona was up on my cosplay list when she came out.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting Process</h2>
    <p>
      This was the first cosplay I made from scratch. I used my green skirt from my Flora Cosmix cosplay to have an easy, free substitute for Sona. The skirt is made of a stretchy 
      bright green fabric, but it was in a hue that fits Sona’s color scheme. Her scarf wings were made of a combination of blue, green, and yellow laser gauze, as laser gauze was 
      the suggested fabric to make those by Riot in their <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/star-guardian-cosplay-guide-part-1">Star Guardian Cosplay Guide</a>. 
      I modified Sona’s cosplay a bit to better fit my personal preferences - instead of having 
      stockings, I converted the stockings into leggings, as they are simpler to put on, and cover my legs adequately. Sona had an underskirt that I used dark turquoise organza to 
      emulate. As for the coat, I constructed the coat using about 2 yards of white poly gabardine, with a bright gold satin to make an edge around the coat as shown in official Riot 
      art for Sona. For patterns, I based the coat off a big flannel shirt I had, I drew the wings based on the art, and the leggings were drafted based on existing selvedge jeans 
      I had.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I sewed and made essentially the whole outfit (minus the wig and the undershirt, which I got off Amazon because I can’t make sleeves), and while I was thoroughly impressed by 
      the first cosplay I made entirely by myself, I felt as if I was missing quite a bit for a proper execution. I hid quite a bit of bad stitchwork in the insides of my coat, 
      I might have sewn the side jacket flaps in the wrong direction, but those mistakes thankfully cannot be seen from a glance. I do wish I knew how to make a proper pointed bow, 
      as my bows look a bit off and droopy - I don’t even know what the style of Sona’s chest and back bows are called. Overall, I loved how the cosplay came out and it shows how 
      much I came far from my earlier homemade cosplays.
