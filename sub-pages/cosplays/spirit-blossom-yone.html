    <!--Why I cosplayed Yone & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Yone</h2>
    <p>
      After the initial successes of Spirit Blossom Thresh, I wanted to cosplay another Spirit Blossom skin, as the skinline has plenty of intricate outfits, almost as much as Genshin Impact charactersâ€™ designs. 
      I love intricate outfits and prefer those when I cosplay rather than simpler outfits as I like cosplaying for attention and dressing up all pretty and fancy. Yone felt like the next champion that subtly blended 
      masculine traits of swordsmen and princes, with the Japanese floral designs and colors to follow suit.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting Process</h2>
    <p>
      I bought the cosplay in March 2022, hoping that it would arrive in time for the Cherry Blossom Festival that year. The cosplay did not come until May, which meant I did not cosplay Yone for the festival, but I fortunately had a new cosplay to show when 
      I decided to go back into cosplaying and cons in general that year by going to FanimeCon, where I was quickly noticed as Yone.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Buying the cosplay did not require much besides just under $100. Then came the 	question of props: Do I spend the extra $70 getting one of Yoneâ€™s canon katanas? The answer is unsurprisingly no, for me at least. It was time to go the 
      cheaper route and get another sword, and initially, I bought a Genshin Skyward Blade from Amazon as a cheap, quick replacement for Yoneâ€™s two katanas in the skinline. I imagined that since I already was planning to attach an Anemo vision onto Yoneâ€™s belt, 
      I might as well buy a Genshin sword. A prop to better pose as Yone shouldnâ€™t hurt! Plus, I can joke about losing 50/50 on the standard banner. Then comes Fanime, where this paid offâ€¦ I was known, as 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CeMLHinBiam/" target="_blank">Riot Games posted a photo of me wielding the Skyward Blade on their official Instagram account.</a> The comments quickly became flooded with people pointing it out while also dying of laughter inside. 
      I surprisingly gained triple the amount of followers I initially had on Instagram, signaling that I keep cosplaying, while blending up League of Legends cosplays with Genshin Impact weapons and visions. Since then, I became most known for League cosplays, with a bit of Genshin flair.
