    <!--Why I cosplayed Evelynn & crafting process-->
    <h2>Why I Cosplayed Evelynn</h2>
    <p>
      K/DA Evelynn was one cosplay I took with me after graduating high school. I first cosplayed Evelynn during a school festival, as I wanted to cosplay and promote my school’s Gender Sexuality Alliance 
      club as they were selling food during the festival. It was cool looking like a diva and introduced me to cosplay wigs and makeup, as my cosplays before K/DA Evelynn in 2019 did 
      not involve me wearing wigs or makeup.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting Process</h2>
    <p>
      I made Eve’s lashers with cheap-looking satin, purple lining, and thread. I bought a black blouse for the cosplay and sewn my own black skirt. For the fur stole, I took a long wide strip of purple faux 
      fur and safety pinned the ends to create arm holes for me to wear on my back and to attach said lashers. I bought the wig online through Amazon, and the glasses came from AliExpress.
    </p>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Evelynn was my first full-on cosplay where I put on a wig and makeup. The only makeup I had when I first cosplayed Evelynn was a light pink eyeliner and the Wet N’ Wild Fuchsia Pearl lipstick. 
      The lipstick fits Evelynn, but the eyeshadow leaves much to be desired as Evelynn needs a more bold, seductive look that needs to be accomplished with black eyeliner and deep magenta and pink eyeshadow shades. 
      Nevertheless, I still appreciated how I started really cosplaying with this K/DA cosplay.
